## CloudFormation Basics

Tool that lets you create, update, delete reources through a template in AWS. 
Templates written in YAML or JSON

YAML: 
-Easier to make mistakes with

-All templates have a list of "resorces"
-The resouces section of a template is the only mandatory section of a template; without resources, the template wouldn't do anything. 
-Description: free text section; only restriction is that if you have both description and an AWSTemplateFormatVersion - if you use both, the description *must* follow the "AWStemplateformatversion". The AWSTemplateFormatVersion is the way AWS allow for extending the standards over time. 
-Metadata controls the UI - how the UI presents the template
-Parameter - add feilds that prompts the user for more information
-Mappings - allow you to create lookup tables
-Conditions - allow decision making in the template; a two-step process. 1: create the condition, 2: Condition is used in Resouces in the template
-Outputs - outputs from the template being applied
